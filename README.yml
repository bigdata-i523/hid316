        The United States Government, through its collection and use
        of biometric data, has leveraged big data in order to protect
        its citizens and keep our country safe. The speed and accuracy
        with which this biometric data can be effectively matched to
        an identity can mean the difference between life and death, as
        well as the integrity of our institutions. This paper
        predominantly focuses on how the United States Government,
        collects, stores, and uses big data to facilitate solving
        crimes and to enhance national security.

        Explores the potential for smart refrigerators enabled with
        services such as Instacart for efficient inventory management,
        automated re-order, food/meal suggestions based on preference
        and health needs.

 Project:
    abstract: >
        This project will use Raspberry Pi3 and Sense Hat to provide
        weather data to Weather Underground's distributed weather
        station network. Data will be analyzed from the weather
        station created for this project along with other home weather
        stations in the immediate vicinity on Weather Underground's
        network to determine variance and accuracy with the general
        (National Weather Service) forecast for my locale. This
        weather forecast is used to drive IoT devices such as Nest,
        which could potentially work more efficiently if they were fed
        with localized weather data sources.
