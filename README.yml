    abstract: "The United States Government, through its collection and use of biometric\
        \ data, has leveraged big data in order to protect its citizens and keep our\
        \ country safe. The speed and accuracy with which this biometric data can\
        \ be effectively matched to an identity can mean the difference between life\
        \ and death, as well as the integrity of our institutions. This paper predominantly\
        \ focuses on how the United States Government, collects, stores, and uses\
        \ big data to facilitate solving crimes and to enhance national security.\
